# quantized.uk

> AI Quantization Intelligence — bridging the gap between research papers and real-world LLM deployment on consumer hardware.

A full-stack static intelligence website for indie developers and geeks who run quantized LLMs locally. It answers the questions people actually have: *"Will this model fit in my VRAM? Which quant format should I pick? How much quality do I lose? What's the exact command to run it?"*

**Live:** https://quantized.uk

## 1. Product Concept

The target audience is developers running LLMs on their own hardware (RTX cards, Apple Silicon, cheap VPS). The site turns scattered, paper-grade quantization knowledge into practical, at-a-glance tooling.

### Core features

| Feature | Route | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | `/` | Hero, live stats, "Today" feed, format heat map, format radar chart, quick links to tools |
| **Quant Hub** | `/quant-hub` | Searchable/filterable index of quantized models with per-quant VRAM, context, speed and quality stats |
| **Benchmarks** | `/benchmarks` | Inference-speed bar chart, perplexity-vs-quant line chart, full comparison matrix |
| **Cookbook** | `/cookbook` | Step-by-step deployment recipes (VPS llama.cpp, Mac Ollama, RTX 4090 vLLM, Docker Compose stack) |
| **VRAM Calculator** | `/tools/vram-calc` | Compute model weights + KV cache + activation overhead; verdict against 33 real GPUs |
| **CLI Generator** | `/tools/cli-gen` | Generate ready-to-run commands for llama.cpp / Ollama / vLLM across Linux / Mac / Docker / Compose |

### Design language

- **Dark-mode first**, glassmorphism surfaces (`.glass`, `.glass-hover`)
- Violet / cyan accent palette, glow effects (`.glow-purple`, `.glow-cyan`)
- High information density — data-rich cards over whitespace
- Framer Motion for hero animations and floating format badges

### Internationalisation

- **English default UI with one-click toggle to Chinese**
- Pure client-side i18n: React Context + `localStorage`, **no URL-based routing** (keeps static export simple)
- The full bilingual dictionary lives in `lib/i18n/translations.ts`

---

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) with `output: 'export'` → static HTML
- **TypeScript** throughout
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling, custom animations in `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Recharts** — radar (format comparison), bar (speed), line (perplexity)
- **Framer Motion** — hero + micro-interactions
- **lucide-react** icons, `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` (`cn()` helper)

> **Zero API calls / zero backend.** Every dataset is a static TypeScript constant under `lib/data/`. This is what makes the whole thing deployable as flat files on a CDN.

## 4. Key Implementation Notes

### VRAM calculation (`lib/utils/vram.ts`)

```
total = model_weights + kv_cache + activation_buffer

model_weights     = params × bpw / 8
kv_cache          = 2 × layers × kvHeads × headDim × contextLen × batchSize × 2 bytes
activation_buffer = 10% of the above
```

`getVerdict(totalGB, gpuVram)` returns `green` / `yellow` / `red` so the calculator can colour-code each GPU.

### CLI generation (`lib/utils/cli.ts`)

`generateCLI(opts)` dispatches by framework and environment, emitting both a shell command and (where relevant) a `docker-compose.yml`. AWQ/GPTQ quant flags are injected automatically for vLLM.

### i18n gotcha

`translations[lang]` infers a union type that doesn't match `typeof translations.en`. The fix is an explicit cast in `context.tsx`:

```ts
const t = translations[lang] as typeof translations.en;
```

### TypeScript / bundler gotcha

`[...new Set(...)]` fails to down-level with the bundler module target. Use `Array.from(new Set(...))` instead (see `ModelCard.tsx`).

---

## 5. Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
npm run build        # static export → ./out
npm run lint
```

The production build emits flat HTML/JS/CSS into `out/`. You can preview it with any static server (`npx serve out`).

---

## 6. Deployment — Cloudflare Pages

The site is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** (static hosting), connected to the GitHub repo for automatic builds on push to `main`.

### Correct configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Framework preset | None / Next.js (Static HTML Export) |
| **Build command** | `npm run build` |
| **Build output directory** | `out` |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Deploy command | *(leave empty)* |

`wrangler.toml` pins the output directory so Pages picks it up automatically:

```toml
name = "quantized"
pages_build_output_dir = "out"
```

### Hard-won lessons (so you don't repeat them)

1. **Use Cloudflare *Pages*, not *Workers*.** Workers run server-side code and cannot serve a static `out/` directory — pointing a Worker at this repo just renders a placeholder ("Hello world"). Pages is purpose-built for static sites and auto-publishes `out/`.
2. **Output directory is `out`, not `.next`.** With `output: 'export'`, Next.js writes flat files to `out/`. Cloudflare's auto-detected `.next` default is wrong for static export.
3. **No deploy command needed.** Pages auto-deploys after a successful build. `wrangler deploy` / `wrangler pages deploy` as a deploy command will fail with an *Authentication error [10000]* unless the build token has the right Pages permissions. If the UI *forces* a non-empty deploy command, use the shell no-op `true` (not `done` — `done` is a reserved shell keyword and throws a syntax error).
4. **Next.js ≥ 14.2.35.** Cloudflare's Wrangler/Pages build pipeline rejects older 14.2.x releases. Pin at least `14.2.35` in `package.json`.
5. **Code must be on the production branch.** Cloudflare builds from `main`; if your work is on a feature branch you'll get `ENOENT: package.json` until it's merged.
6. **Custom domain** (`quantized.uk`) is attached inside the Pages project → *Custom domains*. If you migrate from Workers to Pages, re-bind the domain to the new Pages project.

## 7. Updating Content

All content is data-driven — no code changes required to add data:

- **New model** → append to `lib/data/models.ts` (include `arch` and per-quant stats so the VRAM calculator and hub work)
- **New GPU** → append to `lib/data/gpus.ts`
- **New recipe** → append to `lib/data/cookbook.ts` (provide both EN and ZH fields)
- **New UI string** → add to both `en` and `zh` in `lib/i18n/translations.ts`

Push to `main` and Cloudflare Pages rebuilds and redeploys automatically.
